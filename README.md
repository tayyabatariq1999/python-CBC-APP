# python-CBC-APP
A Python Tkinter desktop app to input and analyze CBC parameters, providing automated diagnostic feedback and interactive visual results for anemia, erythrocytosis, leukopenia, and infection indicators.
Project Overview

This application allows users to input key CBC parameters:

Red Blood Cell Count (RBC)

Hemoglobin (Hb)

Hematocrit (Hct)

White Blood Cell Count (WBC)

It evaluates these inputs against standard reference ranges and flags potential conditions:

Anemia (low RBC, Hb, or Hct)

Erythrocytosis (high RBC, Hb, or Hct)

Leukopenia (low WBC)

Infection or inflammation (high WBC)

An interactive emoji character reacts to the diagnosis, providing an intuitive and engaging way to interpret results.

Features

Input and validation of CBC parameters

Automated diagnostic feedback

Real-time results displayed with emoji visualizations

User-friendly GUI using Tkinter

Lightweight, standalone desktop application

Skills Demonstrated

Python programming & object-oriented design

GUI development with Tkinter

Rule-based data analysis and logic implementation

User experience enhancement through interactive visual elements

Translating clinical data into actionable insights

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>


Navigate to the project folder:

cd CBC-Analyzer


Run the application:

python cbc_app.py


Note: Requires Python 3.x. Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python.

Usage

Launch the application.

Enter CBC parameters in the input fields.

Click Submit to get instant diagnostic feedback.

Observe the emoji character representing your results.

Emoji Examples:

ðŸ˜“ â†’ Anemia detected

ðŸ¤¯ â†’ Erythrocytosis detected

ðŸ˜• â†’ Leukopenia detected

ðŸ¤’ â†’ Infection or inflammation detected

ðŸ˜Š â†’ All values normal

Future Improvements

Include additional CBC parameters (platelets, MCV, MCH)

Add age/gender-specific reference ranges

Include graphical trend visualizations for historical data

Export results as PDF or CSV for record keeping
